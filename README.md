I'm a passionate fullstack web developer upgrading skills everyday. I love to work with Java and Pascal. Yeah, I now it's odd and exotic.
I'm curious by nature and I'm taking advantage on AWS training course to take the Solutions Architect Certification.
I'm thinking about starting a YouTube channel to share my projects and explain how I developed them.
Meanwhile I enjoy watching movies, NBA games and Champions League matches. I'm a great support of Velez Sarsfield futbol club. 
I like to hang out with family and friends on weekends and share a Guiness with them, not everything is about programming!!!!
